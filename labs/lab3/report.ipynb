    "Salted hashes require the computation of rainbow tables for **each** unique salt. This increase in the input space of possible hash-to-password pairs is why it takes a longer time to crack salted hashes (salted rcrack strategies) as compared to non-salted hashes (non-salted rcrack strategies).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is quite a drastic discrepancy in performance with even the addition of a one character salt. This shows the importance of salting. The purpose of salting is to deter rainbow attacks, given its ability to (variably) increase the original plaintext's length. Given the increase in possible input space by one character, an attacker would have to scale up their rainbow tables significantly. Even if such an attacker knows the information that only a 1-character salt was added (as well knowing that it is a lowercase letter), the attacker would still need to deal with a 26-fold multiplicative increase in the space of possible input plaintexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, while it is still technically feasible to compute all the rainbow tables for each salt since the salt's length is only 1 (one lowercase character), we would need to increase our used memory/storage space by 26 to store the 26-fold larger rainbow tables. Such amount of space might not be a luxury anymore, especially in lower end hardware systems. If we generate long salts uniquely attached to each plaintext, it would take a ridiculously large amount of time to compute **all** rainbow tables for **all** salts. As such, salting renders rainbow tables useless since storing extremely massive rainbow tables is impossible in practice, nullifying any possible tradeoff between space and computational time/effort."

    "- Hybrid format (English word/words in leetspeak appended/prepended with random characters) - this would require combination attacks\n",
