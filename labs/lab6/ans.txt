1. We can simply perform the exchange of keys on a public, insecure channel. This is because public keys are meant to be public and known to everyone (i.e., they are open information). No secure channels are necessary to transmit the public keys. Only the private keys are required to be kept in secret.
2. Advantage: Users can communicate on a public channel without any prior knowledge of each other, where each user contributes to the shared key's randomness with no need to trust any middleman, while still ensuring confidentiality and integrity. Disadvantage: It is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack since it lacks any form of authentication procedures, potentially computationally expensive, as well as vulnerable to cracking if primes and generator are not chosen properly such that the generator will only generate to a small subgroup (which will lead to a much smaller cyclic group).
3. As shown in the attached CSV file, it takes a considerable amount of time and effort to crack keys with a larger number of bits. Theoretically speaking, the time and space complexity of the Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm is O(2^(n/2)). However, given enough resources, time, and motivation, several certain third parties might still be able to practically crack the key (such as well-funded secret government intelligence services, agencies, or corporations). As estimated by the authors behind the Logjam attack, a 1024-bit key would cost on the order of $100 million, which is actually within the budget of the USA's NSA. As such, the recommended key size for DHKE is either 2048 or 4096 bits, both of which will take impossibly long and require a ridiculously enormous amount of both computational power and monetary resources. Alternatively, other algorithms such as RSA or elliptic-curve cryptography could be used instead.
